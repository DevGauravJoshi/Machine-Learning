# Numpy vs List

## Data type:

Python lists: Can contain elements of different types.

Numpy arrays: All elements must be of the same type


## Memory efficiency:

Python lists: Less memory-efficient

Numpy arrays: More memory-efficient, especially for large datasets


## Performance:

Python lists: Slower for numerical operations.

Numpy arrays: Much faster for numerical operations, optimized for numerical computing
