## Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Set up a Virtual Environment

#### Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install PyTorch

Visit the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the installation command for your specific operating system and package manager.

### 3. Confirm PyTorch Installation

Create a Python script (e.g., `check_pytorch.py`) and add the following code:

```python
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```

Run the script:

```bash
python check_pytorch.py
```

The output should resemble the following:

```plaintext
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
        [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
        [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
        [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
```

If you see this output, PyTorch is successfully installed.

# Architectures in machine learning

### **1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs):**
- **Description:** The simplest type of artificial neural network where information flows in one direction.
- **Examples:** Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).
- **Use Cases:** Tabular data, basic regression, and classification tasks.

---

### **2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
- **Description:** Specialized networks for processing grid-like data, like images.
- **Key Features:** Convolution layers for spatial feature extraction.
- **Use Cases:** Image recognition, object detection, video processing.

---

### **3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**
- **Description:** Networks with loops that allow information persistence, suited for sequential data.
- **Variants:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
- **Use Cases:** Time-series forecasting, speech recognition, language modeling.

---

### **4. Transformers:**
- **Description:** Architectures that use self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data without relying on recurrence.
- **Examples:** BERT, GPT, Vision Transformers (ViT).
- **Use Cases:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, generative tasks.

---

### **5. Diffusion Models:**
- **Description:** Generative models that learn data distribution by gradually denoising data.
- **Examples:** Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Latent Diffusion Models (used in Stable Diffusion).
- **Use Cases:** Image generation, video synthesis, 3D model generation.

---

### **6. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**
- **Description:** Networks designed to work with graph-structured data.
- **Variants:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs).
- **Use Cases:** Social network analysis, molecular modeling, recommendation systems.

---

### **7. Reinforcement Learning Models:**
- **Description:** Models that learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).
- **Variants:** Deep Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods.
- **Use Cases:** Robotics, game AI, autonomous systems.

---

### **8. Attention-Based Models Beyond Transformers:**
- **Description:** Other models utilizing attention mechanisms outside transformer-based architectures.
- **Examples:** Memory-Augmented Neural Networks, Neural Turing Machines.
- **Use Cases:** Complex reasoning, long-term dependency tasks.

---

### Choosing the Right Model:
The choice depends on your data type, computational resources, and specific use case. For example:
- Vision tasks? Start with **CNNs** or **ViTs**.
- Sequential data? Try **RNNs**, **Transformers**, or **Diffusion Models** for generative tasks.
- Graphs? Use **GNNs**.
